	* By definition, being average is more competitive.
	* The average is safe. Uncertainty is controlled. Risk is eliminated. While comfortable, nothing meaningful grows in this environment.
	* “Bigger Goals = Less Competition” — Tim Ferriss.
	* When you have a big and ambitious goal, think about how you can:
		*  Break it down into a _2-min_ habit.
		-   Make it as _easy_ as possible to execute.
	- **A habit needs to be established before it can be improved.**
	- **Reducing friction makes a good habit the default.**
	-  The 1% intentionally design their lifestyle.
> 	
> 	The 99% let their lifestyle design them.
	
		**You first control friction, and then friction controls your habits.**
	The 1% hang around high-value people and those who challenge them to keep growing.
	* Rather than get jealous of someone’s success, question it.
	* **Don’t steal. Don’t copy. But mimic.**
	**Treat your life like a series of experiments.**
	
		-   Ideate on new ideas.
		-   Rapidly build prototypes.
		-   Constantly test whether they work.
		-   Iterate on what went well. Stop what didn’t go well.
	- The 1% are running multiple experiments and tests. They never stop moving.
	
	The 99% don’t like uncertainty, so they never do anything new. Therefore, they never grow.
	* As Naval Ravikant says,
	
> 	“You want 10,000 iterations, not 10,000 hours.”
	
	***TLDR***
	To be exceptional:
	
	-   Start small
	-   Be careful who’s around you.
	-   Question everything. Even your own deeply held beliefs.
	-   Build a portfolio of experiments.
	-   Learn to bounce back quickly.
	
	Nothing fancy.
	
	All meaningful.
