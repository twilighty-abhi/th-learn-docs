* Writing down interesting ideas, meeting minutes, or even notes about conversations with teammates can be helpful to remember what happened throughout your day. * * Committing pen to paper is a meaningful process that helps to solidify concepts in our minds.
* writing by pen and paper>>>digital typed notes
* When you want to remember something, you have to write it down. When you want to understand something, you have to translate ideas into your own words.
* The more you write things down, the more you start to develop a good knack for thinking up and tracking your ideas
* Without structure, knowledge-sharing is rarely helpful. We lose context quickly as humans, and it can be hard to follow your original train of thought or understand the exact words or phrases you were using.
*  Ideas are fleeting and can be very powerful over time if captured well. Dedicating too much of your focus to content organization versus getting ideas down on paper can mean losing what you want to capture
* You don't want to spend unnecessary energy trying to organize your notes as you're brainstorming with your team and making decisions. You want to have an easy-to-navigate, predictable system for note-taking
* You don't need to treat notes as if they're permanent, precious pieces of information. Notes can be composed together, moved, changed, and evolved over time, just like the code you write!
* ### The PARA method

The [Forte Labs](https://fortelabs.co/) organization describes the PARA method: a universal system for organizing digital information. The system’s four principles are outlined below:

-   Projects: a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
    
    -   Ex: app mockups, product specifications, blog posts
        
-   Areas: a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
    
    -   Ex: professional development, direct reports, products, writing
        
-   Resources: a topic or theme of ongoing interest
    
    -   Ex: project management, linting, teammate information
        
-   Archives: inactive items from the other three categories
    
    -   Ex: Projects that are completed or inactive, areas you’re not committed to anymore, resources that are no longer relevant
